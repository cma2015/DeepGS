<br>
The R package 'DeepGS' can be used to perform genomic selection (GS), which is a promising
breeding strategy in plants and animals. DeepGS predicts phenotypes using genomewide
genotypic markers with an advanced machine learning technique (deep learning). The effectiveness
of DeepGS has been demonstrated in predicting eight phenotypic traits on a population
of 2000 Iranian bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines from the wheat gene bank of the International
Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT)
